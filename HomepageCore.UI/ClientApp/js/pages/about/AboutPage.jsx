                                Hello,
                                <br/><br/>
                                My name is Hai and welcome to my blog.  Be warned however, it is very crappy and prone to extensive periods of inactivity (eg. 6 months+).  
                                <br/><br/>
                                I am a software engineer specializing on the .Net stack and am also passionate about front-end web frameworks such as React and Angular.
                                <br/><br/>
                                At the moment my work primarily focusâ€™ on building web services but have also worked on Windows desktop applications.  I also enjoy site design as a hobby and created all the UI elements you see here.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I am also a certified Umbraco developer, building and extending sites based on the Umbraco CMS platform.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I love what I do and love discussing all things tech related so if you are like minded do not hesitate to <Link to={"feedback"}>get in touch</Link>
